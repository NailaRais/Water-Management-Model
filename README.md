# Advanced Water Management Model

## Overview

The **Advanced Water Management Model** is a web-based application designed to help manage and analyze water resources. It integrates various tools for data visualization, machine learning, and report generation. This model aims to enhance water management practices through advanced analytics and real-time data processing.

## Features

- **Data Input:** Enter and adjust key parameters such as total precipitation and evaporation.
- **Charts and Graphs:** Visualize water usage, desalination efficiency, and water quality through dynamic charts.
- **PDF Report Generation:** Generate and download comprehensive reports in PDF format.
- **Help and Documentation:** Access guidance on using the model and inputting accurate data.

## Libraries and Dependencies

The application uses the following libraries:
- **Chart.js:** For creating interactive charts.
- **Plotly.js:** For advanced data visualization.
- **TensorFlow.js:** For machine learning capabilities.
- **WebSockets:** For real-time communication.
- **html2canvas:** To capture HTML content as images.
- **jsPDF:** To generate PDF files from HTML content.
